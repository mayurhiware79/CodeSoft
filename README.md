**I've had an amazing experience during my CodSoft internship, where I worked on four Java projects. Each project challenged me to think critically and improve my coding skills.**

Here's a quick overview:

### Task 1) Number Guessing Game in Java 🎯
This fun game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. It was a great way to practice loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Java.

### Task 2) Student Grade Calculator 🎓
A handy tool that calculates students' grades based on their scores in different subjects. This project reinforced my understanding of data structures and methods in Java.

### Task 3) ATM Machine in Java 💳
Simulates basic ATM functionalities like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. This project helped me work on OOP concepts and exception handling in Java.

### Task 4) Quiz Application with Timer in Java ⏳
A fully functional quiz application that presents questions one at a time with a timer for each. This project was a perfect exercise in combining user interface with logic and time-based events.
